This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable references to the same data.  The `bug.rs` file contains code exhibiting this error, resulting in a compile-time error from the borrow checker.  The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a corrected version by ensuring that only one mutable reference exists at a time. This highlights the importance of understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system for preventing data races and ensuring program correctness.
